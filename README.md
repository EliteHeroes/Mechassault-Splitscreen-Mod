# Mechassault 3/4 Player Split-Screen Mod

This mod restores a cut split-screen feature that was once planned for Mechassault that allowed up to 4 players simultaneous play! Working in both local play, such as with the grinder game mode, and through system link (online) multiplayer. Please note that this will force the game to always start with 3 or 4 players, so make sure you have the correct amount of controllers connected before play.

## Install Guide

### Pre-requisites

* Need to acquire a copy of Mechassault. Either installed on a modded Xbox or on a PC. If you have an ISO-type file, make sure to convert it so you can directly access the contents of the game files.
* You'll also need to download and install all of [Mechassault's DLC](https://digiex.net/threads/xbox-offline-xbox-live-downloadable-content-dlc-installers.675) for the best and complete experience.
* Make sure you setup and follow the instructions for either the [Mechassault Mod Pack](https://github.com/EliteHeroes/Mechassault-Mod-Pack) or the Base mod first, as this mod requires files found there.

### Installing

1. Download the latest version of the mod from the '[Releases](https://github.com/EliteHeroes/Mechassault-Splitscreen-Mod/releases)' page and extract the contents from 'Mechassault Splitscreen Mod.zip'.
2. Open your Mechassault game folder. For console, you can do this using an FTP program to connect a modded Xbox to a PC.
3. Choose which version is most relevant to your current setup and open that folder, i.e. 4 player Rebalance for the Mechassault Mod Pack install.
4. Drag and drop the file(s) from inside the chosen folder into the Mechassault game folder (where you previously installed the Mod Pack or Base Mod), agreeing to replace the file(s).
5. If necessary, you can now convert the game folder to an XISO format so emulators such as [Xemu](https://xemu.app) can read the new game data.
6. And that's it! You'll now be able to select 'LAUNCH MODS' in the options menu of the game, or you can start the modded game directly with the new N1Launch.xbe

### Help

If the game isn't detecting the newly installed mod, here are some things you can try:

* Make sure to follow the instructions and read the help section found on the [Mechassault Mod Pack](https://github.com/EliteHeroes/Mechassault-Mod-Pack) page or Base Mod if you're having trouble getting the mods to work correctly.
* Check you've chosen the correct version of this mod to install. 3/4 Player Rebalance for the mods that include Rebalance, such as the Mod Pack or the Base Mod version for anything else.
* Also make sure this mod is installed after installing any other mod, as this replaces the xbe file to force the game to always start with 3 or 4 players.

If you're still having any problems with installing, feel free to leave a message in the help section on the [MechDonald's Discord](https://discord.gg/yKpHC5EPz)
