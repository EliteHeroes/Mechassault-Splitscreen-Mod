**Install Guide**
------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-requisites
 - Need to acquire a copy of Mechassault. Either installed on a modded Xbox or on a PC. If you have an ISO-type file, make sure to convert it so you can directly access the contents of the game files.
 - You'll also need to download and install all of Mechassault's DLC for the best and complete experience.
 - Make sure you setup and follow the instructions for either the Mechassault Mod Pack or the Base mod first, as this mod requires files found there.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing
 - Download the latest version of the mod from the 'Releases' page and extract the contents from '3-4.Player.Split-Screen.zip'.
 - Open your Mechassault game folder. For console, you can do this using an FTP program to connect a modded Xbox to a PC.
 - Choose which version is most relevant to your current setup and open that folder, i.e. 4 player Rebalance for the Mechassault Mod Pack install.
 - Drag and drop the file(s) from inside the chosen folder into the Mechassault game folder (where you previously installed the Mod Pack or Base Mod), agreeing to replace the file(s).
 - If necessary, you can now convert the game folder to an XISO format so emulators such as Xemu can read the new game 	data.
 - And that's it! You'll now be able to select 'LAUNCH MODS' in the options menu of the game, or you can start the modded game directly with the new N1Launch.xbe

------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
 - Make sure this mod is installed after installing any other mod, as this replaces the xbe file to force the game to always start with 3 or 4 players.
 - If you wish to revert this, you can replace 'N1Launch.xbe' with the one from the Mod Pack or Base mod.
